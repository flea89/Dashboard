# grunt-express [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/blai/grunt-express.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/blai/grunt-express)

> Start an express/connect web server.
This plugin is largely based on grunt-contrib-connect. It aims to solve the following use cases that grunt-contrib-connect does not seem to have an answer for:

1. Enabling custom express/connect server, especially in cases when socket.io is in the mix (https://github.com/yeoman/express-stack/issues/15#issuecomment-13217532)
2. Watch for changes to the server script(s) and restart the express/connect server (https://github.com/yeoman/express-stack/issues/7)


## Sample app
[grunt-express-example](https://github.com/blai/grunt-express-example) is a minimal example that shows how you can use `grunt-express` to run a basic express/socket.io server set. It will auto-restart server when change is detected.


## Philosophy
The philosophy behind the birth of this mutant of grunt-contrib-connect is:

1. Flexibility. I learned a few lessons from working on some enhancement to [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)'s `server` task. Express.js and Connect are so flexible that the only way to accommodate their full flexibility seems to be accepting a custom module that actually exports such object. An extreme case of this comes from [Socket.io](http://socket.io/#how-to-use), which forces http.Server, express/connect, and socket.io be instanciate in a very specific way.
2. Grunt/Yeoman is mainly for development/deployment. When rung web server in dev environment, following features are in high demand:
  * auto-rebuild/auto-reload (both web browser and server), livereload solved only half of this demand. While it may not be common, livereload on the browser end is also a demand for production environment, so I prefer using [tiny-rl](https://github.com/mklabs/tiny-lr) to manage that in my server bootstrap script, rather than a grunt task.
  * use different base directories where static contents are served. Since development/deployment process is managed by a set of grunt task (and some of the tasks are opinionated), it would seem logical to let grunt task decide which directories to load static contents from.


## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-express --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-express');
```




## Express task
_Run this task with the `grunt express` command._

Note that this server only runs as long as grunt is running. Once grunt's tasks have completed, the web server stops. This behavior can be changed with the [keepalive](#keepalive) option, and can be enabled ad-hoc by running the task like `grunt connect:keepalive`.

This task was designed to be used in conjunction with another task that is run immediately afterwards, like the [grunt-contrib-qunit plugin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-qunit) `qunit` task.
### Options

#### port
Type: `Integer`
Default: `3000`

The port on which the webserver will respond. The task will fail if the specified port is already in use.

#### hostname
Type: `String`
Default: `'localhost'`

The hostname the webserver will use.

#### bases
Type: `String|Array`
Default: `'.'`

The bases (or root) directories from which files will be served. Defaults to the project Gruntfile's directory.

### supervisor
Type: `Boolean|Object`
Default: `false`

Watch for changes and restart the express|connect server. Internally it uses [node-supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) to launch the server in a "supervised" child process. By default this is `false` so the express|connect will be started as part of the grunt process. You may simple set this to `true` to start "supervising" your express|connect server using the following default options(mostly inherited from `node-supervisor`):
```javascript
supervisor: {
  watch: '.',  // map to '--watch' option, Type: String|Array
  ignore: null,  //map to '--ignore' option, Type: String|Array
  pollInterval: 100,  //map to '--poll-interval' option, Type: number
  extensions: 'node|js', //map to '--extensions' option, Type: String
  noRestartOn: 'error'  //map to '--no-restart-on' option: 'error'|'exit'
}
```
If you prefer to roll your own configurations, you may stuff an object instead of just a Boolean `true` for this option. The `--debug` option of supervisor is mapped to the [`debug`](#debug) option of grunt-express.

#### keepalive
Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

Keep the server alive indefinitely. Note that if this option is enabled, any tasks specified after this task will _never run_. By default, once grunt's tasks have completed, the web server stops. This option changes that behavior.

This option can also be enabled ad-hoc by running the task like `grunt connect:targetname:keepalive`

### debug
Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

Turning this option on will make the "supervised" express|connect instance output more debugging messages.

#### server
Type: `String`
Default: null

This option allows you to specify a path to a Node.js module that exports a "connect-like" object. Such object should have the following two functions:

1. `use(route, fn)` (https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/proto.js#L62)
2. `listen()` (https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/proto.js#L227)
_note: you DO NOT want to call the listen() from within your server module, `express` task will take care of that for you_

The simplest example would be:
```js
var connect = require('connect');
module.exports = connect();
```

or if you prefer express.js
```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('hello!');
});
module.exports = app;
```

or if you want to use both express and socket.io
```js
var app = require('express')()
  , server = require('http').createServer(app)
  , io = require('socket.io').listen(server);

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.sendfile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
  socket.emit('news', { hello: 'world' });
  socket.on('my other event', function (data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
});

exports = module.exports = server;
// delegates user() function
exports.use = function() {
  app.use.apply(app, arguments);
};
```

When `server` option is not set, `express` task will generate a plain `connect` object for you.

_note: `express` task will generate `static` and `directory` middleware for each of the `bases` you specified, and load them onto your server (or the generated server) object by calling `use()` function_

[project Gruntfile]: Gruntfile.js
[project unit tests]: test/express_test.js

### Usage examples

#### Basic Use
In this example, `grunt express` (or more verbosely, `grunt express:server`) will start a static web server at `http://localhost:9001/`, with its base path set to the `www-root` directory relative to the gruntfile, and any tasks run afterwards will be able to access it.

```javascript
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({
  connect: {
    server: {
      options: {
        port: 9001,
        bases: 'www-root'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

You may specify more than one `bases` like so. Enhancing the above example, now your server will server static content from both `www-root` folder and `app/public` folder (both are relative path to the `Gruntfile.js`)

```javascript
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({
  connect: {
    server: {
      options: {
        port: 9001,
        bases: ['www-root', 'app/public']
      }
    }
  }
});
```

If you want your web server to use the default options, just omit the `options` object. You still need to specify a target (`uses_defaults` in this example), but the target's configuration object can otherwise be empty or nonexistent. In this example, `grunt express` (or more verbosely, `grunt express:uses_defaults`) will start a static web server using the default options.

```javascript
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({
  connect: {
    uses_defaults: {}
  }
});
```

#### Multiple Servers
You can specify multiple servers to be run alone or simultaneously by creating a target for each server. In this example, running either `grunt connect:site1` or `grunt connect:site2` will  start the appropriate web server, but running `grunt connect` will run _both_. Note that any server for which the [keepalive](#keepalive) option is specified will prevent _any_ task or target from running after it.

```javascript
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({
  connect: {
    site1: {
      options: {
        port: 9000,
        bases: 'www-roots/site1'
      }
    },
    site2: {
      options: {
        port: 9001,
        bases: 'www-roots/site2'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

#### Custom express
Like the [Basic Use](#basic-use) example, this example will start a static web server at `http://localhost:9001/`, with its base path set to the `www-root` directory relative to the gruntfile. Unlike the other example, this will use your custom server script as referred to by `server`! We also set `keepalive` and `watchChanges` to true, so the server will run forever (until you terminate the command), also the server will restart when you apply any changes to your server script.

```javascript
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({
  express: {
    custom: {
      port: 9001,
      bases: 'www-root',
      supervisor: true,
      watchChanges: true,
      server: path.resolve('./server/main')
    }
  }
});
```

any in your `server/main.js`, we reuse the previous sample server script
```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('hello!');
});
module.exports = app;
```
(open [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) and you should see "hello!")

Now let's change `server/main.js`'s content to:
```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('bonjour!');
});
module.exports = app;
```
(refresh browser and you should see "bonjour!")
